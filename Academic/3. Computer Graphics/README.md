**About The Game**

This 2D car racing game is a simple and very friendly game. One player can play the game at a time. Player "Car" moves to positive Y axes while the other random number of cars move toward the Player Car from opposite to hit it and game over. This game designed with 3 column roads. Different music added according to the scenario based. After moving a certain distance, the player car is upgraded to upper stage. The more stages pass, the more it gets difficult to play like the speed of the cars get faster and prone to hit each other, so thus game over. Player will get his score info at top of the window and after the game over top listed players' score card will be displayed.
