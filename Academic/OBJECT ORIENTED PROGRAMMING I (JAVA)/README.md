**Course Info:**
This course is all about learning basic “Java” programming language along with
the implementation of database. The course offers basic Java programming along
with strong OOP concept. During this course I built a desktop-based software
named “Movie Theater Management System” as the final project of this course. For
database I used MySQL (basic SQL queries) and swing in Java for window-based
application.

**Project Info:**
“Movie Theater Management System” contains the following features:

**User Group Management:**
Three kinds of user are introduced in this project. These are:

    1.	Admin/Manager
    2.	Ticket Seller/Customer Manager
    3.	Customer

**User Management:**
The system will have an extensive user module with create/edit users’ info like:

    1.	User Login
    2.	User Access Management
